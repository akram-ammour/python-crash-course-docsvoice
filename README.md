# Python Crash Course

## Variables and Simple Data Types

- **Naming Conventions:** Understand the conventions for naming variables, such as using lowercase with underscores or camelCase.
- **Common Name Errors:** Learn about common errors when naming variables and how to avoid them.
- **Working with:**
  - **Strings:** Manipulating strings, concatenation, string methods (e.g., `upper()`, `lower()`, `split()`), string formatting, etc.
  - **Numbers:** Integers, floats, basic arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus), type conversion, etc.
  - **Boolean:** Understanding boolean values, comparison operators (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical operators (e.g., `and`, `or`, `not`), etc.
- **Working with Constants:** Importance of constants in programming, defining constants using uppercase names.
-

## Conditions

- Introduction to conditional statements in Python, including `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- Understanding boolean expressions and logical operators.
- Nested conditional statements for complex conditions.
- discovering the new switch in python newer versions

## Loops

### For Loops

- Iterating over sequences (e.g., lists, tuples, strings) using `for` loops.
- Using `range()` function for generating numerical sequences.
- Nested loops for iterating over nested data structures.
- Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`).

### While Loops

- Using `while` loops for executing code repeatedly until a condition is met.
- Infinite loops and loop termination conditions.
- Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`).

## Lists

- **Why Lists:** Understand the need for lists and why they are essential in programming.
- **Index:** Definition of an index and its role in accessing elements in a list.
- **Basic Operations:**
  - **Find an Item:** Searching for an item in a list using `index()` method or iteration.
  - **Delete an Item:** Removing an item from a list using `del` keyword, `remove()` method, or `pop()` method.
  - **Copy an Item:** Creating a copy of a list using slicing or `copy()` method.
  - **Remove an Item:** Removing an item from a list by value using `remove()` method.
- **Data Types in Lists:** Lists can contain elements of various data types including strings, numbers, boolean, etc.
- **Indexing:** Accessing elements in a list using positive or negative indices.
- **Slicing:** Extracting a subset of elements from a list using slicing notation.
- **Sorting a List:** Sorting elements of a list using `sort()` method or `sorted()` function, with custom sorting functions.
- **Reversing a List:** Reversing the order of elements in a list using `reverse()` method or slicing.
- **Length:** Determining the length of a list using `len()` function.
- **List Comprehensions:** Creating lists using concise syntax for iteration and conditionals.

## Dictionaries

- Introduction to dictionaries, key-value pairs, common dictionary operations (e.g., adding, accessing, modifying, deleting items), and dictionary methods (e.g., `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`).
- Iterating over dictionaries using loops and comprehensions.
- Dictionary comprehension.

## User Input

- Accepting user input using the `input()` function and handling user responses.
- Validating and sanitizing user input.
- working with dynamic data provided by the user and handling all case scenarios

## Functions

- Defining functions with parameters and return values.
- Function scope and global variables.
- Default parameter values and variable-length argument lists.
- Lambda functions and their use in functional programming.
- `Recursion` and recursive functions.
- `*args`, and `**kwargs`

## Class and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Basics of class and object creation, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Instance and class attributes, methods, and constructors.
- Understanding `self` in Python classes.
- Special methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, etc.).
- Class inheritance and method overriding.
- Encapsulation and access modifiers.
- Polymorphism and method overriding/overloading.
- Abstract classes and interfaces.
- Class composition and aggregation.

## Files and Exceptions

Opening and closing files using the `open()` function and file modes (e.g., read, write, append).

Reading from and writing to files using file objects (e.g., `read()`, `write()`, `readline()`, `writelines()`).

Handling file paths and working with file directories.

Using `with` statement for file operations (context managers).

Exception handling using `try`, `except`, `finally`, `else` blocks.

Catching specific exceptions and raising custom exceptions.

Handling file-related exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`).

And so much more this course was made to make more people attracted to the field of programming and how easily accessible are tools for developers and non-developers wether it's for newbies or complete experienced devs .
